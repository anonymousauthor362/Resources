Abstract - 
Material science has enabled us to develop a wide array of materials that have uses that help us to solve real world problems. One such material is Velostat, a composite polymer with carbon impregnated polyethylene. This material is piezoresistive and is used in pressure sensing applications. In this paper a pressure sensitive mat is made using Velostat and hardware challenges related to scan rate, sensitivity, range and sensor density are addressed.
